# Text Based Browser
The world's most modern web browser if you close your eyes and pretend graphics and CSS don't exist. Run it from the command line with ``python translator.py [directory]``, where ``[directory]`` is the directory on your computer in which you wish for the browser to save your tabs.

Save for that, you use this web browser exactly like you would any other web browser, which you presumably know how to do because you were able to navigate to this page, which you are reading right now, in a web browser.

Written and tested in Python 3.8. Download Python: https://python.org/downloads
